Combined Cycle Power Plant Energy Output Prediction Project
Introduction
👋 Hello everyone,
Today, I will walk you through an exciting project where we employ machine learning to predict the net hourly electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant.

🏭 Why is this Important?
Power plants are the backbone of energy supply, and optimising their performance can lead to significant economic and environmental benefits.

📊 Data at a Glance
We have a dataset comprising 9,568 hourly average ambient readings from sensors at the plant.
Features include Atmospheric Temperature, Exhaust Vacuum, Ambient Pressure, and Relative Humidity.
Our target variable is the Net Hourly Electrical Energy Output.

🛠 Steps Involved
Data Loading and Exploration: Loaded the data and conducted exploratory analysis to understand basic statistics and correlations.
Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into a 70-30 split for training and testing.
Model Selection: Considered Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression algorithms.
Validation Strategy: Used 10-fold cross-validation for model evaluation.

🎯 Metrics and Results
Used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric.
Random Forest model had the lowest RMSE in both cross-validation and test set evaluation, making it our final model.

🔍 Key Takeaways
Machine learning provides a robust approach for predicting power plant energy output.
Random Forest emerged as the most effective model, with an RMSE of 3.35 MW on the test set.
Questions and Further Steps

❓ Open Floor
I am open to any questions you may have.
Future work could involve hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering for further performance gains.

👋 Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to any discussions this presentation may spur.
